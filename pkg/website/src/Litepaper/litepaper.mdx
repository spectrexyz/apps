<H2 label="Introduction" />

The NFT landscape took off at an exponential rate, with capitalizations moving from [$41M in 2018 to $340M in 2020](https://art.art/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NFT-YEARLY-REPORT-2020.pdf). Even though this massive growth was met with contradicting narratives and attitudes, it inspired a variety of sectors including gaming, sports, art, collectibles, and metaverses to dip their toes in this new realm.

However, despite much needed innovations around disintermediated ownership, NFTs continue [the tradition of price setting via auction mechanisms.](https://www.econport.org/content/handbook/auctions/historyofauctions.html#:~:text=Early%20auction%20houses%20were%20created,also%20used%20to%20liquidate%20estates.) These traditional auction models used to determine the discrete *“sale price”* of NFTs end up prohibiting participation from the long-tail of economic actors, while failing to determine the true *“market value”* of artworks. These dynamics replicate and reinforce the logic of exclusivity at the core of  cultural economy as is, leaving the playing field to be dominated by a few wealthy collectors and whales. Despite the unprecedented growth, to many this looks like an incomplete transformation.

But now, Spectre is here to haunt the auction houses. 

Spectre enables anyone to mint ERC20 tokens backed by NFTs to create a **fully liquid and permissionless art market.** Spectre opens up NFT ownership to the crowds, breaking the barbed wires of the "one and indivisible private property" by turning once exclusive NFTs into fungible and liquid assets anyone can buy, sell, pool and govern.

To achieve this purpose, Spectre comes up both as a modular protocol and an opinionated app built on top of it.

<H2 label="Spectre protocol" />

Spectre Protocol has been designed to be **permissionless and modular**. It is built around a **minimal and agnostic core** dedicated to **spectralizing** NFTs: i.e. turning ERC721s into ERC20s. 

This spectralization operation can be **configured through a simple set of customizable parameters** - NFT guardianship, token cap, permissioned operations such as minting or burning, etc. - opening up to **a wide range of set ups and use cases**. This modular architecture **enables anyone to experiment with custom fractionalization processes, token designs, community-governance schemes, etc**.

However, spectralization is a tricky process for newcomers.  How to distribute a token once it has been spectralized - while simultaneously guaranteeing its ongoing liquidity and capital efficiency once this distribution is over? How to enable the original NFT to be eventually unlocked and bought-out?

Spectre Protocol allows anyone to develop **peripheral modules** dedicated to solving these distribution and buyout issues. 

However, we also happen to have some **opinionated ideas on how to best achieve it**. Thus, we have developed our own set of distribution and buyout modules, all integrated with Spectre’s core through a dedicated template contract. This template will transparently be embedded into [spectre.xyz](http://spectre.xyz) frontend to streamline our in-app spectralization experience and help onboard people of all fintech-savvy levels.

Spectre v1 will ship with one distribution module - the **Spectralization Bootstrapping Pool** module - and one buyout module - the **Flash Buyout module** - integrated in the default template. However, we intend to deploy additional distribution and buyout modules in the future.

<Tldr>
Most users should just use the peripheral modules embedded in spectre.xyz template contract and frontend to enjoy the simplest and most efficient spectralization experience. However, advanced users willing to experiment with custom spectralization processes can develop their own modules AND still benefit from the gas efficient infrastructure of Spectre’s core component. The main drawback here is that such users would need to design their own frontend for users to interact with their modules - though they could rely on our UI kit for that.
</Tldr>

### Core

Spectre’s core relies on two simple contracts: the sERC1155 and the sERC20. These two contracts enable anyone to lock an ERC721 compliant NFT and turn it into an ERC20 compliant sERC20 wrapped into the sERC1155. To do so, our sERC1155 contract:

1. Claims ownership of the ERC721.
2. Clones a base ERC20 to create a new sERC20.
3. Derives a new ERC1155 token type from the cloned sERC20 token address.
4. Wraps the ERC721 metadata into the newly created sERC1155 token type’s metadata.
5. Wraps all sERC20 operations into their associated sERC1155 operations.

  alt="Spectre core flow"
/>

This means holding some share of an sERC20 token also means holding some share of the sERC1155 NFT whose metadata are the same than the spectralized ERC721 - and vice-versa. Moreover, transferring some sERC20 tokens simultaneously transfers the associated sERC1155 NFT tokens - and vice versa. This wrapping mechanism enables users to refer to their tokens either as shares of an ERC1155 NFT - which can be displayed into any ERC1155 compatible wallets - or as a purely financial ERC20 asset.

Let’s note that **sERC20 are ERC20 compliant tokens bundled with additional features**. They can be capped, mintable, burnable, snapshot and implement [EIP-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612). This enables users to experiment with a **wide range of ERC20 monetary policies and uses** depending on how they set the token cap and assign the minting, burning and snapshot permissions.

sERC20 are also gas efficient. They rely on [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20) standard and optimized implementation and are deployed through [EIP-1167](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167) minimal proxies. This means the cost of bundling sERC20s with extra features has been paid once - at time of base contract deployment - hence it costs nothing more for the end-user to create yet another clone of it.

### Spectralization Boostrapping Pool

In the last couple of months, Balancer’s [Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools](https://docs.balancer.finance/guides/smart-pool-templates-gui/liquidity-bootstrapping-pool#:~:text=Liquidity%20Bootstrapping%20Pools%20(LBPs)%20are,is%20used%20on%20the%20exchange.) - henceforth denominated LBP - have become the *de facto* solution for Initial Distribution Offerings. However, LBPs do not exactly suit the needs of "Initial sERC20 Distributions" - henceforth denominated ISD.

First, even though LBPs require *less* upfront capital than most competing solutions, they still require *some* upfront capital to bootstrap the liquidity pool. This may not be an issue for most users, but can be a dead-end when it comes to bootstrapping low-cap liquidity pools - not everyone has 10 ETH to spare for an LBP.

Secondly, LBPs rely on a time-based weight adjustment process which can be very hard to decide on for ISD. How long will it take for people to even know of a given ISD? How long will it take for the market to reach an equilibrium? etc.

Finally, LBPs require the pooled supply to be decided on upfront - more often by a dedicated token-engineering team. This can hardly be achieved when it comes to ISDs. Indeed, it is often hard to figure out upfront what an sERC20 circulating supply should be: what is the size of its market? what are its expected dynamics? etc. Moreover, those parameters may change over time: a low value NFT with non-significant demand can turn into a $20M market cap token with a very high demand in the span of weeks. 

Consequently, it is unrealistic to decide upfront what a sERC20 circulating supply should be and how fast it should be put in circulation.

To solve these issues, we have designed a new type of pool AMM for Balancer v2: **Spectralization Bootstrapping Pools** - henceforth denominated SBP. SBPs look a lot like LBP except:
1. They require **no upfront capital**. Thus, it will cost users nothing to bootstrap a SBP and distribute their tokens - other than the gas fees.
2. SBPs enables buyers to **mint sERC20s against ETH** instead of swapping them against ETH. Indeed, when the depth of a liquidity pool is small, *e.g.* at the start of an sERC20 pool lifecycle, swapping sERC20s can incur an important slippage. In such a situation, users can mint (and purchase) additional sERC20s at the current pool price. However, this operation has a cost: **a minting fee**, defined at spectralization time, is charged on the ETH spent to mint those sERC20s and routed to the pool as a reward for liquidity providers. Hence, if this minting fee is lower than the swap slippage for a given ETH amount, it ends up beneficial for the buyer to mint instead of swap - and vice versa. This mechanism **automatically regulates the circulating supply of sERC20s**, as users are incentivized to mint new tokens only if there is a real lack of liquidity in the pool.

/>

3. In SBPs, weight adjustement is not a function of time but a function of circulating supply / cap supply ratio. This way, the more the sERC20s are minted, the more the pool behaves like a regular Uniswap-like 50/50 pool, constituting a natural and continuous source of liquidity for the whole lifecycle of the sERC20. Moreover, such a mechanism makes it so that minting new sERC20s incurs a downward price pressure, thus enabling a sound and fair price discovery process - as LBP do.

### Flash Buyout

The specificity of NFT-backed assets is to turn uniqueness into multitudes and non-fungibility into fungibility. However, this process can be reverted. Someone interested in owning the overall NFT and recovering its non-fungibility may buyout the spectralized ERC721 as a whole to unlock the original NFT and become its owner.

<Illustration

  height={1330}
  src={imgFlashBuyoutFlow}
  alt="Flash buyout flow"
/>

Locking an NFT in Spectre **is a ritual** which induces state change between private and collective ownership. The singular owner must renounce their ownership in order to initiate the process of collectivisation.

Most fractionalization platforms rely on complicated buyout processes involving bids and / or community governance. Though interesting, we believe that on-chain community governance will stay disfunctional as long as L2 technologies have not become mainstream. Moreover, we believe it makes little sense to tie the buyout process to a complicated bid-based price discovery mechanism when the whole point of fractionalization is to turn the NFT market into a effective one. **In an efficient and liquid market, the fair price of a fractionalized NFT is actually given by its market cap.**

However, we introduce two tweaks to this process. First of all, **the NFT guardian may set a buyout multiplier**. This parameter defines how many times the market cap should be paid to buyout the original NFT. It thus serves as a way to price *the sacrality of uniqueness* and how much it should eventually cost to recover the non-fungibility of the NFT and its full ownership. Moreover, the price to be paid does not imply the whole market cap of the token, but only the part of the market cap that is not already owned by the initiator of the buyout.

<Formula
  color="#58FFCA"
  value="effective_buyout_price = max(static_buyout_price, dynamic_buyout_price)"
/>

_where:_

<Formula
  color="#EF79F8"
  value="static_buyout_price = (cap - balance(buyer)) * price_start * multiplier"
/>

_and:_

<Formula
  color="#C0BBFF"
  value="dynamic_buyout_price = (supply - balance(buyer)) * price_daily * multiplier"
/>

Of course, if and when a buyout happens, every token holder can burn their tokens in exchange for their share of the buyout proceeds.

    Besides ensuring a path to unlock NFTs in the contract, the buyout acts as

    distribution, buyout price, etc) can be corrected via a re-spectralization
    (buyout & spectralize) process.
  `}
/>

<H2 label="Spectre app" />

Spectre app (simply, Spectre) is a permissionless and opiniated spectralization template coming with a dedicated frontend and aiming to create optimal yet simple liquidity bootstrapping conditions for NFT spectralization. This app will allow uninitiated users to interact with the protocol without too much overhead on parametrization.

### Spectralizer flow

The spectralization of an NFT through Spectre app follows a simple and minimalistic logic. 

#### 1. NFT mint / lock.

Users can either spectralize existing ERC721 they own or natively mint a new NFT and spectralize it. When they do so, they renounce to the ownership of the NFT.

#### 2. sERC20 issuance.

Users set the sERC20 supply cap - the maximum supply this sERC20 can ever reach. They can also define an array of allocation percentages so that different addresses - original creator, early supporters, etc. - can receive a fixed percentage of the newly minted tokens.

#### 3. Buyout multiplier.

Users define how many times the market cap should be paid to buyout the NFT.

#### 4. Launch!

There are a couple of additional parameters advanced users can optionally tweak to customize their Balancer Spectralization Bootstrapping Pool: fee, weights, etc. Once they are done, our template contract automatically spectralize the NFT, deploy the Balancer pool and set up the buyout process into one single transaction. From now on, users can just enjoy the ride.

### Buyer flow

Let’s dive into the Spectre flow to see how fluid this is.

Bob would like to buy 1 ETH of a spectralized NFT. Spectre automatically computes which route is financially sound: minting or swapping sERC20s. However, Bob always has the ability to force which route he wants to follow if he has reasons to do so.

### Minting flow

1. A minting fee, *e.g.* 5%*,* is deducted from Bob’s ETH and sent to the pool, along with some newly minted sERC20s - to respect the pool ratios. Half of this fee serves as a reward for liquidity providers. The remaining fee is locked until a buyout happens to guarantee some minimal liquidity depth in the pool.
2. The remaining ETH is sent to Alice - or whoever she has set as a beneficiary at spectralization time.
3. Bob’s sERC20s are minted with respect to SBP’s daily average price - to protect against flash loan attacks - and sent to Bob.
4. Alice’s sERC20s are minted with respect to her allocation  - *e.g.* 10% - and sent to Alice.

/>

### Swapping flow

1. A swapping fee, *e.g.* 0.1%, is deducted from Bob’s ETH and sent to the pool as a reward for liquidity providers.
2. The remaining ETH is swapped against sERC20s according to the current pool state and sent to Bob.

<H2 label="Why Spectre?" />

The few existing platforms in the ecosystem of fractional art are mainly aimed at initiated crypto users and those dapps mainly split bluechip NFTs such as cryptopunks, cryptokitties gen-0, cryptocubes and so on. It’s NFT trading for crypto-insiders. Our purpose is radically different: we want to make fractional art ownership an artistic experience of its own by offering everyone the opportunity to play with fractional property. 

Here is a list of features which characterizes Spectre and differentiates it in relation to legacy modes and alternative solutions:

### 1. Permissionless

While blockchain holds the promise of permissionless access and infrastructure as common good, the nature of commerce and platform entrepreneurship is at risk of replicating exclusivity and gatekeeping. Spectre has been designed with permissionlessness at heart. Users can interact with the protocol without needing to register, sign-up or invite.

### 2. Accessibility

Not everyone can afford spending 1 or 2 ETH on a NFT (to say the least). This whale bias prevents communities from extending support towards artistic production. In this light, overcoming the logic of exclusivity also means establishing a new relationship between real audiences and creators.

### 3. Autonomy and disintermediation

With the proliferation of digital art markets on distributed networks, artists are able to bypass legacy infrastructures to independently support their career and livelihoods. This is an essential feature of any art market infrastructure since cultural production heavily relies on the artists ability to stay critical and/or irrational in relation to the dominant power structures present in order to ensure free and autonomous cultural production.

### 4. Price discovery

With spectralized NFTs, value and valuation of art objects are formulated in market terms rather than through discrete auction methods where “the highest bidder” wins. By allowing the crowds to formulate their demands, Spectre empowers the economic expression of the multitude. On the one hand, it enables artists to interface directly with their audiences in a global and open way, freeing them from the monopoly of patronage and reliance on whales. On the other hand, it allows collectors to enjoy continuous price discovery of the works they hold by opening their ownership to the crowds.

### 5. Community & collective curation

Spectralization offers a new medium to creators and collectors alike, shifting the paradigm from hoarding artworks to opening them up to sharing by means of community engagement. This way participatory forms of art can flourish and evolve. 

Additionally, for curators and traders, indexing / smart pooling of liquid NFTs effectively mean well-diversified granular portfolios. This way every wallet can become a museum of sorts, dynamically expressing its curators’ preferences at any given time.

### 6. Equitable art production

By replacing the discrete auction mechanisms with fractionalized, price discovering liquid markets, Spectre allows for the "self-allocation" of a % share of the work towards artists and contributors. This way creators or collectors can stay equitable even in the case of a potential buyout. Use of multi-sig wallets like Gnosis Safe can also act as a module on how to use those funds collectively or to fractalize the allocations to many.

### 7. A new paradigm for developers

We expect developers to also find an interest in Spectre since the creation of liquid NFTs opens a whole new playground for composable blockchain applications like DeFi, allowing anyone to use the spectralized NFTs as collateral for any other kind of asset. In that sense, Spectre makes art-backed stablecoins much more of a possibility. Artist-developers will also find in Spectre an unprecedented opportunity to re-organize relations between the artwork and its market. Aesthetic lands such as creative coding or generative artwork will discover a whole new playground when sERC20 tokens can be used as a data source for the creation of evolutionary work.

<H2 label="Team & roadmap" />

Spectre is, originally, a decentralized emanation of the [Distributed Gallery](https://www.distributedgallery.com/), a collective of artists, designers and engineers who has been creating crypto-artworks since 2017 on the Ethereum blockchain. It also involves former Aragon designers and developers that all met around their passion for blockchain technologies, decentralization, and crypto-art.

<Team />

Here is an overview of our near-term product roadmap – the road to Spectre protocol launch. We are adding the final touches to the contracts & UI, which then will be audited and validated with users right before the product launch, early this summer.

<H2 label="Conclusion" />

We are driven by the desire of turning artworks into an active multitude. The crypto-art movement is still in its infancy but it already shows promising steps in this direction.

We now wish to radicalize this desire to move from a single and exclusive property to collective forms of ownership by offering a gateway that allows any artist or collector to play with these features in their own terms. Features that for practical, legal and technological reasons were, until recently, reserved to a small elite.

Artworks have always been powerful vectors for collective formation. We now see that the internet of value could make us move past a time where artworks were considered as objects of private consumption, to a world where they become, in their inner form, the organizational layer of tomorrow’s collectives.
